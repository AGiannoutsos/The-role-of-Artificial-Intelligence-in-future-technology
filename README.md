# The-role-of-Artificial-Intelligence-in-future-technology

Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved significantly in recent years. The goal of this study is to understand
current achievements and estimate their influence on future technologies. In this investigation, we begin by
looking back at the historical evolution of artificial intelligence. Then, after completing an examination of its
present accomplishments in numerous domains, we will clarify the impact it will have on future technologies.
Finally, we address its limitations, the challenges it faces, and the concerns it raises.
